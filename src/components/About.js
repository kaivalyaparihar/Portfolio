        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm half engineer, half hacker, half musicianâ€”and yes, I know that's three halves. I build things, I break them to make them stronger, and I bring a creative rhythm to everything in between.
        </p>
        <p>
          I offer a range of freelance services designed to bring your ideas to life. My expertise lies in <strong>Web Development</strong>, where I build everything from sleek <strong>portfolio templates</strong> and <strong>SaaS landing pages</strong> using React and Next.js to full-scale organization websites. I also provide <strong>Design & Branding</strong> services, creating everything from social media packs to complete branding kits.

          Beyond development and design, I specialize in creating clear <strong>Technical Content</strong> and building insightful <strong>Data Dashboards</strong> with tools like Power BI. My unique background in mechanical engineering and cybersecurity means I bring a holistic, security-first approach to every project. Whether you need a robust web application or a data-driven solution, let's connect and build something great.
